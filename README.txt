# COLD WAR AUTO STARTER AND PAUSER BY CBRNN  

**How to setup LiveSplit TCP Server**  
- Open Livesplit
- Right click -> Control -> Start TCP Server

**Config Guidance**  
The reset delay tells the timer how long after a reset is triggered it should start.
Too early leads to various different issues.
The cutscene length is the length of the mid-game cutscene for your given map

**Known Limitations**  
The pause/unpause may experience a <0.05 delay due to latency between the application and TCP server.
This should generally even out over time.


**Reset Delay Timing**  
- FBZ: 9.96

**Cutscene Timing**
- FBZ: 85

NOTES
- It is advised to fast restart on your first reset
